            <h1>Microlearning - is it the future of Learning?</h1>
            <p>
              Learning is a lifelong activity. People do not stop learning after
              they earn their diplomas. Unlike high school or college courses
              however, people have more control over how, when, and what they
              learn after graduation.
            </p>
            <p>
              In some cases, courses can actually be done in a matter of hours.
              These days, experts have found courses designed for microlearning
              to be quite effective in helping learners acquire new skills and
              develop habits.
            </p>
            <p>
              For those who are employed or are preparing to get employed,
              additional training programs are necessary to ensure that they are
              properly equipped for the demands of their jobs. The need to
              upgrade their skills and knowledge is apparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              What might not be too apparent is that it’s not only in the
              corporate setting that people need to upgrade themselves. Learning
              can be elective as part of one’s desire to develop himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              He can choose to learn anything from cooking and crafting to high
              tech coding and programming. With microlearning, people can
              effectively learn new things on their own without having to attend
              conventional corporate training sessions or enrolling in formal
              school-based classes.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Microlearning ?</h2>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;"
                >In simple terms, micro learning can be defined as way of
                learning wherein the lessons are limited to short and concise
                sessions. The time factor and the scope of learning are not the
                only considerations.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>However, Three key elements should be present:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Performance Objective</span> –
                the focus of each session should be clear and a concrete
                learning outcome should be specified at the onset. The learner
                should know exactly what performance improvement to expect after
                he has completed the session.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Single Learning Activity</span>
                – the session or lesson should be delivered using only one type
                of activity (i.e. game, video, Q&A, simulation, etc.) that
                tackles the given concept. Choosing which type of activity to
                use in the session would depend on the given topic as well as
                the target students.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;"
                  >Broader Learning Strategy </span
                >– although micro learning sessions can stand on their own, they
                should be part of a broader strategy that is composed of other
                sessions covering similar or related skills and concepts.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The use of the micro learning technique is now widely accepted in
              online training and mobile learning. Many are offered as
              subscription services wherein students or learners can simply
              access whatever session they wish to take at any given time.
              Gamification has also increased the attractiveness as well as the
              effectiveness of these online courses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether for personal development or professional growth, there is
              no denying that micro learning is one of the most effective and
              widely used methods of digital education nowadays. This has been
              proven both in scientific studies and in real life experiences.
            </p>
            <h2>Conventional Learning vs Microlearning</h2>
            <p>
              In broad terms, people learn through systematic education and
              day-to-day experiential education. Systematic education refers to
              formal education wherein learners attend class in institutions of
              learning or in training venues. Learning is highly structured and
              performance measures are set towards the goal of awarding a degree
              or a certification to those who successfully complete the courses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Day-to-day experiential education involves an informal type of
              learning wherein people pick up information, knowledge, and even
              skills from their day-to-day experiences and interactions with
              other people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Such learning happens in a non-structured manner and perhaps not
              intentional as well. Learning in this sense often depends on
              factors like influence, exposure, and interest. This type of
              learning does not often result in any performance evaluation and
              grading or in any professional qualification.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another type of conventional learning is non-formal education.
              This comes by way of training sessions that mostly focus on skills
              acquisition and development. Apprenticeships and mentoring fall
              under this category of learning. Through this mode of education,
              people learn through practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Microlearning takes various elements from all these three types of
              education. Although this method of learning can also be applied to
              formal, non-formal, and informal learners, it actually takes on a
              form of its own when applied to adult learners.
            </p>
            <p>
              Compared to conventional types of learning, micro courses are
              elective, more learner-centric, and flexible. This type of
              learning supports lifelong and continuous learning – something
              that is considered to be a necessity for personal fulfillment and
              success.
            </p>
            <h2>Microlearning in Science</h2>
            <p>
              Scientific studies have proven that the brain’s absorption and
              retention of information and data is limited. It is thus sensible
              for micro learning to expose the brain to small chunks of
              information in shorter periods of time. This is comparable to the
              chunking concept of
              <span style="font-style: italic;">George Miller</span>, a
              psychologist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another scientist also put forth a theory about how the human
              brain retains the information it is exposed to.
            </p>
            <p>
              In research studies by German psychologist
              <span style="font-style: italic;">Hermann Ebbinghaus</span>,
              results showed a common forgetting curve among learners where
              information learned is “forgotten” exponentially over time. Within
              a few days of exposure to the learning materials, retention drops
              to about 40% and then further down to 21% in a month’s time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The human memory has also been affected by available technology
              today. Experts believe that memory is a skill that needs to be
              practiced to remain sharp.
            </p>
            <p>
              With memory tools and data storage devices available today, people
              have become more dependent on these external banks rather than
              their own memory. The lack of use weakens the memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              These researches and the way technology has affected how the human
              brain retains information have spurred the development of using
              micro courses in learning and education.
            </p>
            <h2>Benefits and Disadvantages of Microlearning</h2>
            <p>
              “Quick and easy” is perhaps one phrase that would apply to
              learning through micro courses. There is more to this method of
              learning, however, than the scope and duration of each module.
            </p>
            <p>
              As there are advantages that can be gained, there are also
              downsides to this method. Briefly, here are some of the benefits
              and disadvantages of micro courses:
            </p>
            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;"
                  >Rich media format delivery</span
                >
                – snippets of information are delivered in rich media formats,
                making this type of learning more engaging and exciting for the
                learners. The lessons are delivered in the media that’s deemed
                to be more effective in helping the learners absorb the
                information within a short period of time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Learner-centric</span> – this
                type of learning takes the learners needs and preferences into
                consideration in the design of the short-burst modules. Learners
                get the specific lessons that they need and are interested in
                without having to wait for class schedules or for an instructor.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;"
                  >Just-in-time availability</span
                >
                – the lessons are available just at the right time when the
                learner needs or wants them. This saves time and effort for the
                learners as they get the information they require in a
                convenient manner. At the same time, the desired knowledge and
                skills are gained almost immediately so the learners can apply
                them right away.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple-device access</span> –
                anytime, anywhere learning is made possible when the elearning
                modules are available and accessible not only through desktops
                and laptops but through mobile devices such as smartphones and
                laptops. In fact, quick smartphone games and 2- to 3-minute
                YouTube videos are popular and effective formats for
                microlearning modules.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fragmented learning </span>–
                because the lessons are given in short bursts, learners might
                have difficulties in linking the ideas to each other. In the
                case of personal development, learners could even choose to skip
                modules or only take those micro modules that they are
                interested in.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Uncertainty of synthesis </span
                >– micro courses are usually taken solo or on an individual
                basis. There is no instructor or mentor to ensure that the
                learner completely understood all the modules and is able to
                synthesize all the information to achieve his learning and
                performance goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;"
                  >Differences in learner reception and understanding </span
                >– not everyone learns the same way and not every lesson can
                effectively be learned in short bursts. The results of micro
                learning depends on whether the micro courses are designed to
                match the student’s learning style and if the subject matter can
                be broken down and encapsulated successfully.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With proper design and administration of micro courses, the
              downsides of this method of learning can be addressed to maximize
              the benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Experts in micro learning should be able to devise ways to
              mitigate these issues through additional content like overviews,
              diagnostics, and course summaries.
            </p>
            <h2>Examples of Microlearning</h2>
            <p>
              The beauty of this learning method is the flexibility and
              versatility that it offers course developers and educators. They
              can actually make the modules more exciting and thus easier to
              absorb and retain by the learners. Here are some examples of how
              creative the modules can be:
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Game apps </span>– educators
              can use short games that can be played on mobile devices like
              tablets and smartphone. One such app is
              <span style="font-style: italic; color: chartreuse"
                >MinecraftEdu.</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Learners of different ages and grade levels can choose the games
              that cover the topics and subject matters they need to study.
              Specific learning objectives are set to be met at the end of the
              game. The app also features games that allow teacher-student
              interaction as well as partner or group collaboration.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Quizzes </span>– this is
              another popular interactive online tool for elearning. Quizzes are
              not only limited for use as diagnostics. They can be used to
              stimulate critical thinking and open the mind for new information.
            </p>
            <p>
              A quick 5- item quiz with each question followed by a short
              discussion of the correct answer would be a good example of a
              microlearning module.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-style: italic; color: chartreuse">Duolingo</span
              >, a language learning app, also makes use of quizzes to
              effectively measure performance. As these quizzes are graded right
              away, learners get feedback on what areas they need to work on
              more.

              Through this app, those who wish to learn a new language can take
              short lessons that cover speaking and listening as well as
              translating. After these short lessons, they can take quizzes and
              earn points in the process.

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Flashcards </span>– there is
              nothing new about the use of flashcards in learning and retaining
              new information. In micro courses, however, flashcards take on a
              digital form.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are programs like

                >Flashcard Learner</span
              >
              that can be downloaded by users. Some of these programs already
              have built in lessons, while there are also those that users can
              customize based on what they wish to learn.

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Gamification</span> – yet
              another exciting way to learn and relax at the same time. As
              opposed to simply playing a game app, a gamified elearning online
              tool would immerse the learner in the concepts he should learn and
              allows him to practice them in a safe and risk-free virtual
              environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the process, he is rewarded with points that earn him the
              recognition of climbing up the leaderboards and being awarded with
              badges.
            </p>

              are examples of gamified ways of learning. In this case, the
              microlearning focuses on health and fitness concepts and rewards
              the users for constant and consistent activity.

              <span style="font-weight: bold;">5. Blended learning </span>– this
              makes use of the combination of micro courses and traditional
              in-classroom learning methodologies. While the student maintains
              control over when and where he gets his modules, this application
              of the microlearning method of learning puts a teacher or an
              instructor into the picture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of live lectures, blended learning features instructional
              videos. The instructor serves to facilitate structured activities
              in-classroom and to guide the students in problem solving using
              the new concepts they learned in the micro courses.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;"
                >6. Video tutorials and instructional </span
              >– these combine the learning experience with entertainment.
              That’s why “How-to” videos on YouTube are very popular. When
              anyone needs a quick less on how to do virtually anything under
              the sky, he can simply do an online search and find a video to
              walk him through the entire process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The beauty about these videos is that they often skip through all
              the technical jargon and actually shows you exactly how things are
              done step by step.
            </p>

              <span style="font-style: italic; color: chartreuse"
                >Oreo’s simple illustrated videos</span
              >, for instance, show their audience how to make delicious goodies
              and treats using easy to follow recipes. These videos run for
              under 25 seconds, yet they effectively teach their audience
              something new.
            </p>
            <p>
              To supplement the videos, links to the recipes are provided as
              well so that the viewers can try the whole process on their own or
              perhaps make the recipes as they view the video.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              One piece at a time, of course. The same thing applies to
              learning. You cannot possible digest a huge body of information in
              one sitting. You need to divide it into bite-sized pieces that are
              easy for you to wrap your mind around.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">
                That’s what microlearning is all about.</span
              >
              It’s scientifically proven to be effective. At the same time, it’s
              an even more exciting and engaging way to learn new things on your
              own and upgrade your knowledge and skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is really no limit to learning and education. Limitations
              like age, time, and resources can successfully be hurdled by those
              who thirst for new learning. Continuously upgrading yourself is
              not impossible to do if you truly desire it.
